# Redesign-with-SASS 
> Redesigning the FOIL-UI-Framework with SASS 


> Notes:

> We might have to use SASS. Since FOIL-UI needs to be expanded more. 



## Installing SASS: 

> `sudo npm -g install sass`

## How to test your changes in SASS

> `sass --watch FOIL-UI.scss FOIL-UI.css`
> It is recommended to use an IDE or a editor that supports multi split 
> feature. 


## How to compile FOIL-UI

> `sass FOIL-UI.scss FOIL-UI.css`



## What is the goal? 

#### Why SASS? 
> FOIL-UI.css is growing and efficiency when writing FOIL-UI.css by hand, is kinda difficult.
> With SASS, the ability to have variables, functions, for loops and all that is amazing.
