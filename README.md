# Variable Test 
> Testing some more CSS features. 


> Notes:

> We might have to use SASS. Since FOIL-UI needs to be expanded more. 



## Installing SASS: 

> `sudo npm -g install sass`

## How to compile FOIL-UI? 

> `sass --watch FOIL-UI.scss FOIL-UI.css`
> It is recommended to use an IDE or a editor that supports multi split 
> feature.
